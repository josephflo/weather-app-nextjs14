            My name is Franco and I am a Fullstack Web Developer. Although I
            enjoy working on both sides, Frontend and Backend, I feel a bit more
            comfortable on the Frontend side. I am fascinated by the world of
            programming, I am a proactive person who is always looking to learn
            and grow, both professionally and personally. I feel identified with
            a phrase that I read and share: "Nothing in the world can take the
            place of perseverance." I characterize myself for always being
            responsible, well predisposed and committed to my tasks, and easy to
            adapt to new work teams.
